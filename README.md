A bunch of utils that I've been creating along the way.

# Scripts

## Images Gallery with Titles

Displays the image file name as a title at the bottom of the image container.

Inspired [by a forum post workaround](http://answers.squarespace.com/questions/990/display-image-titles-under-gallery-grid-thumbnails), modified for not requiring lightbox


Include the _js_ as a _Code Block_ at the bottom of the page, don't forget the _<script>_ tags.
